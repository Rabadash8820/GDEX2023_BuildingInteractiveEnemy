# Live Demo: Building an Interactive Enemy

## Overview

This repo contains all source code and assets from my GDEX 2023 presentation _Live Demo: Building an Interactive Enemy_.
Watch the [recording](./) of the talk for background. Slides are publically available on [One Drive](./).

The Unity project is contained in the `SpaceGame/` folder. Its `Assets/` folder contains subfolders for several third-party assets.
All first-party assets are stored in the `SpaceGame/` subfolder, grouped by "feature" (`player`, `monster`, `world`, etc.).
Open the single scene file at `scenes/main.unity` to see how it's all put together!

The game itself, _"Space Game"_, is basically a treasure hunt through space,
where the player must dodge asteroids and monsters to collect all "treasures" and bring them back to the space station.
Players can also use a simple "gravity gun" to push and pull asteroids out of the way.
Check out the origial [design doc](./original-design-doc.md).
